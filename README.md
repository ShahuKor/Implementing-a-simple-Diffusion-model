# Implementing a simple Diffusion model using Pytorch

In this repository I have tried to build a diffusion model in Pytorch.
The complete notebook code is done by understanding the fundamentals of a Diffusion model and how is it useful to generate images.
Things that I have used :
- Noise Scheduler
- Neural Network (U-Net)
- Timestep Encoder

Due to hardware limitations I could only run this model to 20 EPOCHS. If we implement the same on a good GPU, and do 100-200 EPOCHS, the results would be fantastic!
